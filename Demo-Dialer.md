# Demo-Dialer

> [!Note]
> This is an incomplete demo dialer but functional. The dial-pad below is now connected only to `to field`.
> You can dial manually by typing the call receiver in the `to field`.
> For the `from field`, copy the Twilio Test Account number `2314844105`.
> Please note that this is a free test account from Twilio, and you will receive a voice message stating that you need to upgrade to use the service, wait for a minute or two as it is deployed through Render for FREE.
