# Sample Bar Graph

## For the Chart.JS with day, week and month view.

Create a basic bar chart built with Chart.JS. Here's the reference link: https://github.com/rprinceroger/ChartJS

I choose the Stack Bar Graph design, as we have multiple campaigns per law firm.
- They would be able to compare each campaign side by side or get the total of all campaigns.
- We have a few filter  options for days, weeks, and months.
- Then cross out to hide a campaign/s.
