# Build an Ad Attribution Dashboard

> [!Note]
> Need the necessary credentail to use Facebook Marketing SDK
> 1. Ad Account ID
> 2. Facebook Developer app - App ID
> 3. App Secret
> 4. Developer Access Token 

- By using the Facebook Marketing SDK we would be able to fetch the CPC (cost per click), CPM (cost per mille - 1,000 impressions), CPA (cost per action) and CVR(convertion rate, though will be creating our own computation for the cost per lead instead using the CVR of Facebook).

- As discussed with Sir JP, these information should reflect on our dashboard in the following computation: 

- [] Total Cost / CPC
- [] Total Cost / CPM
- [] Total Cost / CPA
- [] Cost Per Lead that we can manipulate.
